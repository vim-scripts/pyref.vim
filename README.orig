The file "pyref.vim" is a plug-in for the Vim text editor that maps the <F1>
key in Python buffers to search through the Python language and library
reference documentation for the keyword or identifier at the current cursor
position and open the first match in your web browser. This works in both
graphical Vim and console Vim.

The search works by scanning through a special index file with keyword, URL
pairs separated by tabs and delimited by newlines. You can create this index
yourself using a Python script I've written (see the file "create-index.py")
or you can download the index that I've already created (see the file
"vimpythonindex").

 USAGE
=======

Save the file "pyref.vim as" ~/.vim/plugin/pyref.vim (if you're on Windows save
the file as %USERPROFILE%\vimfiles\plugin\pyref.vim), likewise save the file
"vimpythonindex" as ~/.vimpythonindex (if you're on Windows then save this file
as %USERPROFILE%\_vimpythonindex) and restart Vim. Now try it out: Open some
Python source code in Vim and press the <F1> key. If it doesn't work out of the
box you probably need to change the global variable "pyref_browser" to the
filename or pathname of a working web browser executable, e.g. inside Vim type:

    :let pyref_browser = '/usr/bin/konqueror'
